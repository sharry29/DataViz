This dataset allowed for many questions to be explored, and our set of initial sketches reflected this variety: we attempted visualizations that demonstrated the changes through time in all available metrics; we used bar plots to compare qualities of boroughs side by side; we leveraged the familiarity of New York geography to create visualizations that showed the boroughs’ data in 2D space. Meeting to revise our sketches, we felt that changes through time made for the most compelling stories to be told with visualizing this data. Additionally, we recognized that the quality of our visualization improved when we made its scope specific: instead of trying to summarize changes in all of the fields, we narrowed our focus to showing how one quality of New York populations changed through ten years across all five boroughs.
We chose to illustrate patterns of household occupancy in New York, both how they vary through time and across the boroughs. A bar chart allows us to quickly compare the total numbers of households in each of the five boroughs, answering questions about how households are distributed among the boroughs and where the city expanded over the course of a decade. The segmentations of the bar chart illustrate how households in the city are occupied: are they rented out? Occupied by their owners? Or left vacant? The paired bars for each borough allow for quick inspection of changes through time within a borough, and the reduced opacity (but consistent coloring) of the 2000 bar indicates that the same quantities are shown, albeit at a different time of measurement. Placing the paired bars in descending order of number of households in 2010 reveals instantly which boroughs are largest and smallest, and has the added benefit of allowing us to place the “2000/2010” legend on only one pair of bars, to where we believe that the viewers’ eyes will first be drawn.
